  documentation: Stasis is a condition exclusively caused by the Hibernator Ability,
    which only two Bots can have. Essentially, when a Bot is in Stasis, it cannot
    choose to do anything for that turn (it gets skipped), but when its turn comes
    around for it to use a move, it heals 1/4 of its Max Endurance and 1/4 of its
    Max Energy. The condition alternates turns (so the Bot can only do something
    every other turn)
  BattleMessage: Ensure this bots next move always hits
