The assets in this folder have been moved to a folder called Deprecated~.

The ~ hides it from being detected in the Unity Editor (and therefore from builds).

This is to ensure that texture assets that have been replaced by shaders or meshes are not accidentally reused somewhere else and forces adherance.

At the discretion of a keyholder, the Deprecated~ folder (and this readme, and possible the parent folder) can be deleted.
