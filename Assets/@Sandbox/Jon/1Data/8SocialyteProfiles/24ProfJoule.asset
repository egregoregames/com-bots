  occupation: Vice Dean of the Global Combotics Academy
  origin: Hamburg
  bio: GCA's harshly disciplinarian vice-dean, handpicked for the role by her mentor,
    Prof. Newton. While she knows her way around a ComBot battle, Joule is more confident
    in the office, ensuring GCA's legacy for years to come. While she tends to terrify
    younger students, upperclassmen revere her for her intellect and her commitment
    to the student body.
