  - An odd duck obsessed with media and a hobby involving "Secret Codes," Marconi
    is smart--he even invented his own transmitter--but people think he's weird,
    and he doesn't have many friends. He's an intern at Cybercast Studios, where
    he is working on a project to beam Cybercast directly into people's brains. Still,
    most see him as harmless, if a bit strange.
