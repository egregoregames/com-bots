  bio: A fellow first-year at GCA, Damien hides his talent for music and combotics
    behind a moody exterior. In battle, Damien commands Devilbot to great effect,
    pulling off complex maneuvers that suprise and confuse his opponents to the delight
    of his bandmates in the Meming Screamies--his own dour fan club. In recognition
    of Damien's promise, Dr. Yama entrusted the Solex of Cunning to him.
