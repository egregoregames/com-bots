  - A fellow first-year at GCA, Blaise is an otaku through-and-through, with a dedication
    to emulating the impossibly fit bodies of the heroes in his animes. He trains
    his body alongside the equally-intense Flamebot, although even Blaise's closest
    friends can find themselves overwhelmed by his intensity. Ultimately, he aspires
    to a professional roboletics career. In recognition of Blaise's promise, Dr.
    Yama entrusted the Solex of Energy to him.
