  bio: A fellow first-year at GCA, Blaise is an otaku through-and-through, with a
    dedication to emulating the impossibly fit bodies of the heroes in his animes.
    He trains his body alongside the equally-intense Flamebot, although even Blaise's
    closest friends can find themselves overwhelmed by his intensity. Ultimately,
    he aspires to a professional roboletics career. In recognition of Blaise's promise,
    Dr. Yama entrusted the Solex of Energy to him.
