  bio: A fellow first-year at GCA, Morgan doesn't always prioritize her studies,
    often taking time to pursue her two passions of butterfly-catching and doll-collecting.
    Yet, when her teammates are counting on her, she and Fairybot never let them
    down, eagerly assuming an invaluable support role. In recognition of Morgan's
    promise, Dr. Yama entrusted the Solex of Friendship to her.
